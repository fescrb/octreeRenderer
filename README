[Requirements]:

At least one OpenCL sdk must be installed. 

A python script is provided to ease CMake argument selection.

[Building]:

Using the python script:

	python build.py

The executable will be located in bin/octreeRenderer.

Alternatively, we can build without using Python: Make a directory so as not to pollute the source tree:

	mkdir bin; cd bin
	
Generate the makefiles using CMake:

	cmake ..
	
Then invoke the makefile:

	make
	
You will find the executable in src/octreeRenderer from the current directory.
